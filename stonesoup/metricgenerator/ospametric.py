        Computes the Optimal SubPattern Assignment (OSPA) metric for a single
        time step between two point patterns. Each point pattern consisting of
        a list of :class:`~.State` objects.

        The function :math:`\bar{d}_{p}^{(c)}` is the OSPA metric of order
        :math:`p` with cut-off :math:`c`. The OSPA metric is defined as:

            .. math::
                \begin{equation*}
                    \bar{d}_{p}^{(c)}({X},{Y}) :=
                    \Biggl( \frac{1}{n}
                    \Bigl({min}_{\substack{
                        \pi\in\Pi_{n}}}
                            \sum_{i=1}^{m}
                                d^{(c)}(x_{i},y_{\pi(i)})^{p}+
                                c^{p}(n-m)\Bigr)

        ----------
        track_states: list of :class:`~.State`
        truth_states: list of :class:`~.State`
