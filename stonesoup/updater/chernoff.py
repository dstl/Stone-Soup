class ChernoffUpdater(Updater):
    r"""A class which performs state updates using the Chernoff fusion rule. In this context,
    measurements come in the form of states with a mean and covariance (compared to traditional
    measurements which contain solely a mean). The measurements are expected to come as
    :class:`~.GaussianDetection` objects.


    The Chernoff fusion rule is written as [#]_

    .. math::
           p_{\omega}(x_{k}) = \frac{p_{1}(x_{k})^{\omega}p_{2}(x_{k})^{1-\omega}}
                                    {\int p_{1}(x)^{\omega}p_{2}(x)^{1-\omega} \mathrm{d} x}

    where :math:`\omega` is a weighting parameter in the range :math:`(0,1]`, which can be found
    using an optimization algorithm.

    In situations where :math:`p_1(x)` and :math:`p_2(x)` are multivariate Gaussian distributions,
    the above formula is equal to the Covariance Intersection Algorithm from Julier et al [#]_.
    Let :math:`(a,A)` and :math:`(b,B)` be the means and covariances of the measurement and
    prediction respectively. The Covariance Intersection Algorithm was reformulated for use in
    Bayesian state estimation by Clark and Campbell [#]_, yielding formulas for the updated
    covariance and mean, :math:`D` and :math:`d`, and the innovation covariance matrix, :math:`V`,
    as follows:

    .. math::

            D &= \left ( \omega A^{-1} + (1-\omega)B^{-1} \right )\\
            d &= D \left ( \omega A^{-1}a + (1-\omega)B^{-1}b \right )\\
            V &= \frac{A}{1-\omega} + \frac{B}{\omega}


    In filters where gating is required, the gating region can be written using the innovation
    covariance matrix as:

    .. math::

            \mathcal{V}(\gamma) = \left\{ (a,A) : (a-b)^T V^{-1} (a-b) \leq \gamma \right\}


    The specifics for implementing the Covariance Intersection Algorithm in several popular
    multi-target tracking algorithms was expanded upon by Clark et al [#]_. The work includes a
    discussion of Stone Soup and can be used to apply this class to a tracking algorithm of
    choice.

    Note
    ----
    If you have tracks that you would like to use as measurements for this updater, the
    :class:`~.Tracks2GaussianDetectionFeeder` class can be used to convert the tracks to the
    appropriate format.
