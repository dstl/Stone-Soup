class AlphaBetaUpdater(Updater):
    r"""Conceptually, the :math:`\alpha-\beta` filter is similar to its Kalman cousins in that it
    operates recursively over predict and update steps. It assumes that a state vector is
    decomposable into quantities and the rates of change of those quantities. We refer to these as
    position :math:`p` and velocity :math:`v` respectively, though they aren't confined to
    locations in space. If the interval from :math:`t_{k-1} \rightarrow t_k` is :math:`\Delta T`,
    and at :math:`k`, we can gain a (noisy) measurement of the position, :math:`p^z_k`.

    The recursion proceeds as:

    * Predict

    .. math::

        p_{k|k-1} &= p_{k-1} + \Delta T v_{k-1}

        v_{k|k-1} &= v_{k-1}

    * Update

    .. math::

        s_k &= p^z_k - p_{k|k-1} \: (\mathrm{innovation})

        p_k &= p_{k|k-1} + \alpha s_k

        v_k &= v_{k|k-1} + \frac{\beta}{\Delta T} s_k

    The :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` parameters which give the filter its name are small,
    :math:`0 < \alpha < 1` and :math:`0 < \beta \leq 2`. Colloquially, the larger the values of the
    parameters, the more influence the measurements have over the transition model; :math:`\beta`
    is usually much smaller than :math:`\alpha`.

    As the prediction is just the application of a constant velocity model, there is no
    :math:`\alpha-\beta` predictor provided in Stone Soup. It is assumed that the predictions
    passed to the hypothesis have been generated by a constant velocity model. Any application of a
    control model is also assumed to have taken place during the prediction stage.

    This class assumes the velocity is in units of the length per second. If different units are
    required, scale the prior appropriately.

    The measurement model used should be linear and a measurement model such that it provides a
    'mapping' to :math:`p` via the :attr:`mapping` tuple and a binary measurement matrix which
    returns :math:`p`. This isn't checked.
