class BoundingBoxDetectionReducer(Feeder):
    """ Reduce detections by selecting only ones placed within the limits of a
        n-dimensional bounding box, defined on the detection coordinate space.

        When provided with the limit coordinates of a given n-dimensional
        bounding box (expressed in the form of min/max bounds on each
        dimension), the feeder will apply a filter to the incoming data,
        allowing to pass through only detections that fall within the desired
        limits, and discarding the rest.

        Assuming a 2D Cartesian detection space, the feeder operation is
        equivalent to drawing an imaginary bounding box tangential to the plane
        defined by the XY axes, and only feeding detections whose state vector
        falls within the bounds of the box.

        Note
        ====
        * For the time being, the bounding box limits must be defined on
          the same coordinate axes as the received detections, which are in
          turn assumed to all share a common coordinate frame.
        * For example, assume we are tracking some targets in Lat/Lon, but
          receive detections in the form of polar coordinates (e.g. relative to
          a single Radar sensor), then the bounding box MUST be defined
          on (a subset of) the polar coordinate system, and NOT the
          geo-spatial.
        * Thus, it is worth noting that in its current version the feeder is
          not recommended for use in filtering data coming from multiple
          sources/sensors, unless a common coordinate frame is guaranteed.
        * Finally, for simplicity purposes, the bounding box is not allowed to
          rotate around any axis.
