    Feeder consumes Track objects and outputs GaussianDetection objects.

    At each time step, the :attr:`Reader` feeds in a set of live tracks. The feeder takes the most
    recent state from each of those tracks, and turn them into a set of
    :class:`~.GaussianDetection` objects. Each detection is given a :class:`~.LinearGaussian`
    measurement model whose covariance is equal to the state covariance. The feeder assumes that
    the tracks are all live, that is each track has a state at the most recent time step.
