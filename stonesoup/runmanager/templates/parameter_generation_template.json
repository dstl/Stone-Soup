# Remove all comments from this file before running.

# Configuration: Configuration is where you set certain constraints on your Simulations.
# proc_num: means number of processing cores to use when using the multiprocessing option. Set this to your maximum number of CPU cores.
# runs_num: means the number of monte carlo runs you want to run for a cofiguration file. 

#Parameters: Parameters are the parameters you want to use for each simulation. These should match the parameters
available in your configuration file.
# n_samples: This is the number of samples you want to generate for each simulation. For instance you want 5 different values 
between the min and max of the parameter.
# path: This is the stone soup object that you wish to change.
# type: This is the type of the specific stone soup object you wish to change. 
Supported types are: StateVector, int, float, Probability, bool, CovarianceMatrix, DateTime, Tuple, timedelta, ndarray
# value_max: This is the maximum value you want to use in the simulation.
# value_min This is the minimum value you want to use in the simulation.
