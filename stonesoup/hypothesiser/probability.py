    def hypothesise(self, track, detections, timestamp):
        r"""Evaluate and return all track association hypotheses.

        For a given track and a set of N detections, return a
        MultipleHypothesis with N+1 detections (first detection is
        a 'MissedDetection'), each with an associated probability.
        Probabilities are assumed to be exhaustive (sum to 1) and mutually
        exclusive (two detections cannot be the correct association at the
        same time).

        Detection 0: missed detection, none of the detections are associated
        with the track.
        Detection :math:`i, i \in {1...N}`: detection i is associated
        with the track.

        The probabilities for these detections are calculated as follow:

        .. math::

          \beta_i(k) = \begin{cases}
                \frac{\mathcal{L}_{i}(k)}{1-P_{D}P_{G}+\sum_{j=1}^{m(k)}
                  \mathcal{L}_{j}(k)}, \quad i=1,...,m(k) \\
                \frac{1-P_{D}P_{G}}{1-P_{D}P_{G}+\sum_{j=1}^{m(k)}
                  \mathcal{L}_{j}(k)}, \quad i=0
                \end{cases}

        where

        .. math::

          \mathcal{L}_{i}(k) = \frac{\mathcal{N}[z_{i}(k);\hat{z}(k|k-1),
          S(k)]P_{D}}{\lambda}

        :math:`\lambda` is the clutter density

        :math:`P_{D}` is the detection probability

        :math:`P_{G}` is the gate probability

        :math:`\mathcal{N}[z_{i}(k);\hat{z}(k|k-1),S(k)]` is the likelihood
        ratio of the measurement :math:`z_{i}(k)` originating from the track
        target rather than the clutter.

        NOTE: Since all probabilities have the same denominator and are
        normalized later, the denominator can be discarded.

        Parameters
        ----------
        track: :class:`~.Track`
            The track object to hypothesise on
        detections: :class:`list`
            A list of :class:`~Detection` objects, representing the available
            detections.
        timestamp: :class:`datetime.datetime`
            A timestamp used when evaluating the state and measurement
            predictions. Note that if a given detection has a non empty
            timestamp, then prediction will be performed according to
            the timestamp of the detection.

        Returns
        -------
        : :class:`~.MultipleHypothesis`
            A container of :class:`~SingleProbabilityHypothesis` objects
