        ----------
        track : Track

        detections : set of :class:`~.Detection`
            Detections used to generate hypotheses.
        timestamp : datetime.datetime
            A timestamp used when evaluating the state and measurement
            predictions. Note that if a given detection has a non empty
            timestamp, then prediction will be performed according to
            the timestamp of the detection.

        : sequence of :class:`~.Hypothesis`
            Ordered sequence of "best" to "worse" hypothesis.
