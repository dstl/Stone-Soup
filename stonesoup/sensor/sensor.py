    """Sensor Base class for general use.

    Most properties and methods are inherited from :class:`~.BaseSensor`, but this class includes
    crucial functionality and so should be used in preference.

    All sensors must be mounted on a platform to calculate their position and orientation. To
    make this easier, if the sensor has a position and/or orientation specified in the constructor,
    and no :attr:`platform_system`, then the default is to create an internally held "private"
    platform for the Sensor. This restricts the later setting of the :attr:`platform_system` but
    does allow the Sensor to control (and set) its own position and orientation.
