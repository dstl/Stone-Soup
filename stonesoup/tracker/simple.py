class SingleTargetTracker(Tracker):
    """A simple single target tracker.

    Track a single object using Stone Soup components. The tracker works by
    first calling the :attr:`data_associator` with the active track, and then
    either updating the track state with the result of the :attr:`updater` if
    a detection is associated, or with the prediction if no detection is
    associated to the track. The track is then checked for deletion by the
    :attr:`deleter`, and if deleted the :attr:`initiator` is called to generate
    a new track. Similarly if no track is present (i.e. tracker is initialised
    or deleted in previous iteration), only the :attr:`initiator` is called.

    Attributes
