    """
    This approach determines the platforms attitude based upon its velocity
    component. It does not take into account potential platform roll, nor
    are the components calculated to account for physical artifacts such as
    platform trim (e.g. aircraft yaw whilst flying forwards).

    The process determines the yaw (x-y) and pitch (z to x-y plane) angles.
    The rotation matrix for a rotation by yaw around the Z-axis is then
    calculated, the rotated Y axis is then determined and used to calculate the
    rotation matrix which takes into account the platform pitch

    Parameters
    ----------
    vec: StateVector
        platform velocity

    -------
    np.ndarray
