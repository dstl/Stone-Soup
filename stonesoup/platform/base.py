    """A platform that can carry a number of different sensors.

    The location of platform mounted sensors will be maintained relative to
    the sensor position. Platforms move within a 2 or 3 dimensional
    rectangular cartesian space.

    A simple platform is considered to always be aligned with its principle
    velocity. It does not take into account issues such as bank angle or body
    deformation (e.g. flex).

    Movement is controlled by the Platform's :attr:`Platform.movement_controller`, and access to
    attributes of the Platform is proxied to the movement controller, to allow the Platform to
    report its own position, orientation etc.

    If a ``movement_controller`` argument is not supplied to the constructor, the Platform will
    try to construct one using unused arguments passed to the Platform's constructor.

    .. note:: This class is abstract and not intended to be instantiated. To get the behaviour
        of this class use a subclass which gives movement
        behaviours. Currently, these are :class:`~.FixedPlatform` and
