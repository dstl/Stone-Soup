# %%
# A joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) filter handles multi-target tracking through
# clutter. Similar to the PDA, the JPDA algorithm calculates hypothesis pairs for every measurement
# for every track. The weight of a track-measurement hypothesis is calculated by the normalised sum
# of conditional probabilities that every other track is associated to every other measurement
# (including missed detection). For example, with 3 tracks :math:`(A, B, C)` and 3 measurements
# :math:`(x, y, z)` (including missed detection :math:`None`), the probability of track :math:`A`
# being associated with measurement :math:`x` (:math:`A \to x`) is given by:
#
# .. math::
#       p(A \to x) &= \bar{p}(A \to x \cap B \to y \cap C \to z)\\
#                  &+ \bar{p}(A \to x \cap B \to z \cap C \to y) +\\
#                  &+ \bar{p}(A \to x \cap B \to None \cap C \to z) +\\
#                  &+ \bar{p}(A \to x \cap B \to None \cap C \to y) + ...
#
# where :math:`\bar{p}(multi-hypothesis)` is the normalised probability of the multi-hypothesis.

# %%
# Simulate ground truth
# ---------------------
# As with the multi-target data association tutorial, we simulate two targets moving in the
# positive x, y cartesian plane (intersecting approximately half-way through their transition).
# We then add tru detections with clutter at each time-step.
