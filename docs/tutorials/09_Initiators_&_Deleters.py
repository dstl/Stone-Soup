9 - Initiators & Deleters
=========================
So far we have provided a prior in all our examples, defining where we think our tracks will start.
This has also been for a fixed number of tracks. In practice, targets may appear and disappear
all the time. This could be because they enter/exit the sensor's field of view.
The location/state of the targets' birth may also be unknown and varying.
"""

# %%
# Simulating multiple targets
# ---------------------------
# Here we'll simulate multiple targets moving at a constant velocity. A Poisson distribution will
# be used to sample the number of new targets which are born at a particular timestep, and simple
# draw from a uniform distribution will be used to decide if a target will be removed. Each target
# will have a random position and velocity on birth.

# Creating a Deleter
# ------------------
# Here we are going to create an error based deleter, which will delete any :class:`~.Track` where
# trace of the covariance is over a certain threshold, i.e. when we have a high uncertainty. This
# simply requires a threshold to be defined, which will depend on units and number of dimensions of
# your state vector. So the higher the threshold value, the longer tracks that haven't been
# updated will remain.

# Creating an Initiator
# ---------------------
# Here we are going to use a measurement based initiator, which will create a track from the
# unassociated :class:`~.Detection` objects. A prior needs to be defined for the entire state
# but elements of the state that are measured are replaced by state of the measurement, including
# the measurement's uncertainty (noise covariance defined by the :class:`~.MeasurementModel`). In
# this example, as our sensor measures position (as defined in measurement model
# :attr:`~.LinearGaussian.mapping` attribute earlier), we only need to modify the values for the
# velocity and its variance.
#
# As we are dealing with clutter, here we are going to be using a multi-measurement initiator. This
# requires that multiple measurements are added to a track before being initiated. In this example,
# this initiator effectively runs a mini version of the same tracker, but you could use different
# components.

# tracks that are to be removed. Then the initiator is called with the unassociated detections, by
# removing the associated detections from the full set. The order of the deletion and initiation is
# important, so tracks that have just been created, aren't deleted straight away. (The
