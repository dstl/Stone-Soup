# %%
#
# This tutorial introduces the sensor manager classes in Stone Soup which can be used to build simple sensor management
# algorithms for tracking and state estimation. The intention is to further build on these base classes to develop more
# complex sensor management algorithms.
#
# Background
# ----------
#
# Sensor management is the process of deciding and executing the actions that a sensor, or group of sensors
# will take in a specific scenario and with a particular objective, or objectives in mind. The process
# involves using information about the scenario to determine an appropriate action for the sensing system
# to take. An observation of the state of the system is then made using the sensing configuration decided
# by the sensor manager. The observations are used to update the estimate of the collective states and this
# update is used (if necessary) to determine the next action for the sensing system to take.
#
# A simple example can be imagined using a sensor with a limited field of view which must decide which direction
# it should point in at each time step. Alternatively, we might construct an objective based example by imagining
# that the desired target is fast moving and the sensor can only observe one target at a time. If there are
# multiple targets which could be observed the sensor manager could choose to observe the target that had the
# greatest estimated velocity at the current time.
#
# The example in this notebook considers two simple sensor management methods and applies them to the same
# ground truths in order to quantify the difference in behaviour. The scenario simulates 3 targets moving on
# nearly constant velocity trajectories and a radar with a specified field of view, which can be pointed in a
# particular direction.
#
# The first method, using the class :class:`~.RandomSensorManager` chooses a direction to point in randomly
# with equal probability. The
# second method, using the class :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager` considers every possible direction the
# sensor could point in and uses a
# reward function to determine the best choice of action.
# In this example the reward function aims to reduce the total uncertainty of the track estimates at each time step.
# To achieve this the sensor manager chooses to look in the direction which results in the greatest reduction in
# uncertainty - as represented by
# the Frobenius norm of the covariance matrix.
#
# Sensor management as a POMDP
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Sensor management problems can be considered as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) where
# observations provide information about the current state of the system but there is uncertainty in the estimate
# of the underlying state due to noisy sensors and imprecise models of target evaluation.
#
# POMDPs consist of:
#  * :math:`X_k`, the finite set of possible states for each stage index :math:`k`.
#  * :math:`A_k`, the finite set of possible actions for each stage index :math:`k`.
#  * :math:`R_k(x, a)`, the reward function.
#  * :math:`Z_k`, the finite set of possible observations for each stage index :math:`k`.
#  * :math:`f_k(x_{k}|x_{k-1})`, a (set of) state transition function(s). (Note that actions are excluded from
#    the function at the moment. It may be necessary to include them if prior sensor actions cause the targets to
#    modify their behaviour.)
#  * :math:`h_k(z_k | x_k, a_k)`, a (set of) observation function(s).
#  * :math:`\{x\}_k`, the set of states at :math:`k` to be estimated.
#  * :math:`\{a\}_k`, a set of actions at :math:`k` to be chosen.
#  * :math:`\{z\}_k`, the observations at :math:`k` returned by the sensor.
#  * :math:`\Psi_{k-1}`, denotes the complete set of 'intelligence' available to the sensor manager before deciding
#    on an action at :math:`k`. This includes the prior set of state estimates :math:`\{x\}_{k-1}`, but may also
#    encompass contextual information, sensor constraints or mission parameters.

#   :alt: Illustration of sequential actions and measurements
#
# :math:`\Psi_k` is the intelligence available to the sensor manager at stage index :math:`k`, to help
# select the action :math:`a_k` for the system to take. An observation :math:`z_k` is made by the sensing system,
# giving information on the state :math:`x_k`. The action :math:`a_k` and observation :math:`z_k` are added to the
# intelligence set to generate :math:`\Psi_{k+1}`, the intelligence available at stage index :math:`k+1`.
#
# Comparing sensor management methods using metrics
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The performance of the two sensor management methods explored in this tutorial can be assessed using metrics
# available from the Stone Soup framework. The metrics used to assess the performance of the different methods
# are the OPSA metric [#]_, SIAP metrics [#]_ and an uncertainty metric. Demonstration of the OSPA and SIAP metrics
# can be found in the Metrics Example.
#
# The uncertainty metric computes the covariance matrices of all target states at each time step and calculates the
# sum of their norms. This gives a measure of the total uncertainty across all tracks at each time step.

# Sensor Management example

#
# Setup
# ^^^^^
#
# First a simulation must be set up using components from Stone Soup. For this the following imports are required.

# %%
# Generate ground truths
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Following the methods from previous Stone Soup tutorials we generate a series of combined linear Gaussian transition
# models and generate ground truths. Each ground truth is offset in the y-direction by 10.
#
# The number of targets in this simulation is defined by `ntruths` - here there are 3 targets travelling in different
# directions. The time the simulation is observed for is defined by `time_max`.
#
# We can fix our random number generator in order to probe a particular example repeatedly. This can be undone by
# commenting out the first two lines in the next cell.

# Create sensors
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Create a sensor for each sensor management algorithm. This tutorial uses the
# :class:`~.RadarRotatingBearingRange` sensor. This sensor is an :class:`~.Actionable` so
# is capable of returning the actions it can possibly
# take at a given time step and can also be given an action to take before taking
# measurements.
# See the Creating an Actionable Sensor Example for a more detailed explanation of actionable sensors.
#
# The :class:`~.RadarRotatingBearingRange` has a dwell centre which is an :class:`~.ActionableProperty`
# so in this case the action is changing the dwell centre to point in a specific direction.

# %%
# Create the Kalman predictor and updater
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Construct a predictor and updater using the :class:`~.KalmanPredictor` and :class:`~.ExtendedKalmanUpdater`

# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# First create `ntruths` priors which estimate the targets’ initial states, one for each target. In this example
# each prior is offset by 0.5 in the y direction meaning the position of the track is initially not very accurate. The

# Create sensor managers
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Next we create our sensor manager classes. Two sensor manager classes are used in this tutorial
# - :class:`~.RandomSensorManager` and :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager`.
#
# Random sensor manager
# """""""""""""""""""""
#
# The first method :class:`~.RandomSensorManager`, randomly chooses the action(s) for the sensor to take
# to make an observation. To do this the :meth:`choose_actions`
# function uses :meth:`random.sample()` to draw a random sample from all possible directions the sensor could point in
# at each time step.

from stonesoup.sensormanager import RandomSensorManager

# %%
# Brute force sensor manager
# """"""""""""""""""""""""""
#
# The second method :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager` iterates through every possible action a sensor can take at a
# given time step and selects the action(s) which give the maximum reward as calculated by the reward function.
# In this example the reward function is used to select a direction for the sensor to point in
# such that the total uncertainty of the tracks will be
# reduced the most by making an observation in that direction.

from stonesoup.sensormanager import BruteForceSensorManager

# %%
# Reward function
# """""""""""""""
# A reward function is used to quantify the benefit of sensors taking a particular action or set of actions.
# This can be crafted specifically for an example in order to achieve a particular objective. The function used in
# this example is quite generic but could be substituted for any callable function which returns a numeric
# value that the sensor manager can maximise.
#
# The :class:`~.UncertaintyRewardFunction` calculates the uncertainty reduction by computing the difference between the
# covariance matrix norms of the
# prediction, and the posterior assuming a predicted measurement corresponding to that prediction.

from stonesoup.sensormanager.reward import UncertaintyRewardFunction

# %%
# Initiate the sensor managers
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Create an instance of each sensor manager class. Each class takes in a `sensor_set`, for this example
# it is a set of one sensor.

# %%
# Run the sensor managers
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# For both methods the :meth:`choose_actions`
# function requires a time step and a tracks list as inputs.
#
# For both sensor management methods, the chosen actions are added to the sensor and measurements made.
# Tracks which have been observed by the sensor are updated and those that haven't are predicted forward.
# These states are appended to the tracks list.
#
# First a hypothesiser and data associator are required for use in both trackers.

# - i.e. pointing its dwell centre in that given direction.
#
# The :meth:`choose_actions` function from the :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager` is called at each time step.
# This means that at each time step, for each track:
#
#  * A prediction is made for each track and the covariance matrix norms stored
#  * For each possible action a sensor could take, a synthetic detection is made using this sensor configuration
#  * A hypothesis is generated based on the stored prediction and synthetic detection
#  * This hypothesis is used to do an update and the covariance matrix norms of the update are stored
#  * The difference between the covariance matrix norms of the update and the prediction is calculated
#
# The overall reward is calculated as the sum of the differences between these covariance matrix norms
# for all the tracks observed by the possible action. The sensor manager identifies the action which results
# in the largest value of this reward and therefore largest reduction in uncertainty and returns the optimal
# sensor/action mapping.

# The chosen action is given to the sensor, measurements are made and the tracks updated based on these measurements.
