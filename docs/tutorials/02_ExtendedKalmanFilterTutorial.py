2 - Non-linear models: extended Kalman filter
=============================================
"""

# %%
# As well as introducing various aspects of the Stone Soup framework, the previous tutorial
# detailed the use of a Kalman filter. A significant problem in using the Kalman filter is that it
# requires transition and sensor models to be linear-Gaussian. In practice, many models are not
# like this and so alternatives are required. We examine the most commonly-used of such
# alternatives, the extended Kalman filter [#]_ (EKF), in this tutorial.
#
# Background
# ----------
#
# Recall that the Kalman filter makes the following linear assumptions of the predicted state and
# predicted measurement:
#
# .. math::
#       \mathbf{x}_{k|k-1} &= F_{k} \mathbf{x}_{k-1} + B_{k}\mathbf{u}_{k}\\
#       \mathbf{z}_{k|k-1} &= H_{k} \mathbf{x}_{k|k-1}
#
# The EKF gets round the fact that :math:`f(\cdot)` and :math:`h(\cdot)` are not of this form by
# making linear approximations about :math:`\mathbf{x}_{k−1} = \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k−1}` or
# :math:`\mathbf{x}_{k|k−1} = \boldsymbol{\mu}_{k|k−1}`. It does this by way of a Taylor expansion,
#
# .. math::
#       g(\mathbf{x})\rvert_{\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{\mu}} \approx \sum\limits_{|\alpha| \ge 0}
#       \frac{(\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})^{\alpha}}{\alpha !}
#       (\mathcal{D}^{\alpha} g)(\boldsymbol{\mu})
#
# This is usually truncated after the first term, meaning that either
# :math:`\tilde{F}(\mathbf{x}_{k-1}) \approx J(f)\rvert_{\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{\mu}_{k-1}}` or
# :math:`\tilde{H}(\mathbf{x}_{k|k-1}) \approx J(h)\rvert_{\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{\mu}_{k|k-1}}`
# or both, where :math:`J(\cdot)` is the Jacobian matrix. The calculation of the covariances,
# including the innovation covariance, then proceeds in exactly the same way as in the Kalman
# filter using these approximations,
#
# .. math::
#       \mathbf{x}_{k|k-1} &= f_{k}(\mathbf{x}_{k-1}) \\
#       P_{k|k-1} &= \tilde{F}_{k}P_{k-1}\tilde{F}_{k}^T + Q_{k}\\
#       \mathbf{x}_{k} &= \mathbf{x}_{k|k-1} +
#                         \tilde{K}_k(\mathbf{z}_k - h_k(\mathbf{x}_{k|k-1}))\\
#       P_{k} &= P_{k|k-1} - \tilde{K}_k \tilde{H}_{k} P_{k|k-1}\\
#
# where,
#
# .. math::
#       \tilde{K}_k &= P_{k|k-1} \tilde{H}_{k}^T \tilde{S}_k^{-1}\\
#       \tilde{S}_k &= \tilde{H}_{k} P_{k|k-1} \tilde{H}_{k}^T + R_{k}
#
# (we omit the control term in this analysis but it also can be incorporated as a non-linear
# approximation of the same form.)
#
# Stone Soup implements the EKF
# for non-linear functions using a finite difference method to find :math:`J(\cdot)`
# in the appropriate places. We'll now see this in action.

# A bearing-range sensor
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# We're going to simulate a 2d bearing-range sensor. An example of this is available in Stone Soup
# via the :class:`~.CartesianToBearingRange` class. As the name suggests, this takes the Cartesian
# state input and returns a relative bearing and range to target. Specifically,
#
# .. math::
#       \begin{bmatrix}
#       \theta\\
#       r\\
#       \end{bmatrix}
#       =
#       \begin{bmatrix}
#       \arctan\left(\frac{y-y_p}{x-x_p}\right)\\
#       \sqrt{(x-x_p)^2 + (y-y_p)^2}
#       \end{bmatrix}
#
# where :math:`x_p,y_p` is the 2d Cartesian position of the sensor and :math:`x,y` that of the
# target. Note also that the arctan function has to resolve the quadrant ambiguity and so is
# implemented as the :class:`~.numpy.arctan2`:math:`(y,x)` function in Python.
from stonesoup.models.measurement.nonlinear import CartesianToBearingRange
sensor_x = 50  # Placing the sensor off-centre
sensor_y = 0

measurement_model = CartesianToBearingRange(
    ndim_state=4,
    mapping=(0, 2),
    noise_covar=np.diag([np.radians(0.2), 1]),  # Covariance matrix. 0.2 degree variance in
    # bearing and 1 metre in range
    translation_offset=np.array([[sensor_x], [sensor_y]])  # Offset measurements to location of
    # sensor in cartesian.
)

# We create a set of detections using this sensor model.

# function to get coordinates.

# Set up the extended Kalman filter elements
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Analogously to the Kalman filter, we now create the predictor and updater. As is our custom
# the predictor takes a transition model and the updater a measurement model. Note that if either
# of these models are linear then the extended predictor/updater defaults to its Kalman equivalent.
# In fact the extended Kalman filter classes inherit nearly all of their functionality from the
# Kalman classes. The only difference being that instead of returning a matrix, in the extended
# version the :meth:`~.MeasurementModel.matrix()` function returns the Jacobian.
from stonesoup.predictor.kalman import ExtendedKalmanPredictor
predictor = ExtendedKalmanPredictor(transition_model)

from stonesoup.updater.kalman import ExtendedKalmanUpdater
updater = ExtendedKalmanUpdater(measurement_model)

# %%
# Run the extended Kalman filter
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# First, we'll create a prior state.
from stonesoup.types.state import GaussianState
prior = GaussianState([[0], [1], [0], [1]], np.diag([1.5, 0.5, 1.5, 0.5]), timestamp=start_time)

# %%
# Next iterate over hypotheses and place in a track.
from stonesoup.types.hypothesis import SingleHypothesis
from stonesoup.types.track import Track

track = Track()
for measurement in measurements:
    prediction = predictor.predict(prior, timestamp=measurement.timestamp)
    hypothesis = SingleHypothesis(prediction, measurement)  # Group a prediction and measurement
    post = updater.update(hypothesis)
    track.append(post)
    prior = track[-1]

# %%
# Plot the resulting track complete with error ellipses at each estimate.

plotter.plot_tracks(track, [0, 2], uncertainty=True)
plotter.fig

# %%
# Key points
# ----------
# 1. Non-linear models can be incorporated into the tracking scheme through the use of the
#    appropriate combination of :class:`~.Predictor`/:class:`~.TransitionModel` or
#    :class:`~.Updater`/:class:`~.MeasurementModel`
# 2. Because Stone Soup uses inheritance, the amount of engineering required to achieve this is
#    minimal and the interface is the same. A user can apply the EKF components in exactly the same
#    way as the KF.

# %%
# The first order approximations used by the EKF provide a simple way to handle non-linear tracking
# problems. However, in highly non-linear systems these simplifications can lead to large errors in
# both the posterior state mean and covariance. In instances where we have noisy transition, or
# perhaps unreliable measurement, this could lead to a sub-optimal performance or even divergence
# of the filter. In the next tutorial, we see how the **unscented Kalman filter** can begin to
# addresses these issues.
