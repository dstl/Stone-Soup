Stone Soup is a software project to provide the target tracking and state
estimation community with a framework for the development and testing of
tracking and state estimation algorithms.

As Stone Soup is focused on development and testing of algorithms, and such
components may not be the most optimised implementations, instead focusing on
being flexible. Its also intended to aid choice of component/algorithms
to tackle real world problems.

Stone Soup is under active development, where feedback and contributions are
welcomed to grow the number of components and features available.

Please see the Stone Soup :ref:`auto_tutorials/index:Tutorials` for learning
about tracking and using Stone Soup, :ref:`auto_examples/index:Examples` for
examples of Stone Soup features, and :ref:`auto_demos/index:Demonstrations`
for demonstrations of using Stone Soup.
