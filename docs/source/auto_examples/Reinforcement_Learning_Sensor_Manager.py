Reinforcement Learning Sensor Manager
=====================================
This example looks at how to interface a reinforcement learning framework with a Stone Soup sensor manager.

# %%
# Making a Reinforcement Learning Sensor Manager
# ----------------------------------------------
# This example introduces using a Deep Q Network (DQN) reinforcement learning (RL) sensor management algorithm
# in Stone Soup. This is compared to the performance of a brute force algorithm using the same metrics shown in the
# sensor management tutorials. This example is similar to the sensor management tutorials, simulating 3 targets and a
# :class:`~.RadarRotatingBearingRange` sensor which can be actioned to point in different directions.
# 
# Tensorflow-agents is used as the reinforcement learning framework. This is a separate python package that can be found
# at https://github.com/tensorflow/agents.
#
# .. warning::
#    This currently only works on Linux based OSes, or via Windows Subsystem for
#    Linux (WSL). MacOS users may be able to make use of a Linux VM to run this example. See Tensorflow instructions for
#    creating Python virtual environments (with GPU support if applicable) [#]_.

# tf-agents[reverb]``.

# Create sensors
# --------------
# Create a sensor for each sensor management algorithm. This tutorial uses the
# :class:`~.RadarRotatingBearingRange` sensor. This sensor is an :class:`~.Actionable` so
# is capable of returning the actions it can take at a given time step and can also be given an action to take before
# measuring.
# See the :doc:`Creating an Actionable Sensor Example <Creating_Actionable_Sensor>` for a more
# detailed explanation of actionable sensors.
#
# The :class:`~.RadarRotatingBearingRange` has a dwell centre which is an :class:`~.ActionableProperty`
# so in this case the action is changing the dwell centre to point in a specific direction.

# %%
# Create the Kalman predictor and updater
# ---------------------------------------
# Construct a predictor and updater using the :class:`~.KalmanPredictor` and :class:`~.ExtendedKalmanUpdater`
# components from Stone Soup. The :class:`~.ExtendedKalmanUpdater` is used because it can be used for both linear
# and nonlinear measurement models. A hypothesiser and data associator are required for use in both trackers.

# %%
# Generate Priors
# ----------------------
# First create `ntruths` priors which estimate the targetsâ€™ initial states, one for each target. In this example
# each prior is offset by 0.1 in the y direction meaning the position of the track is initially not very accurate. The
# velocity is also systematically offset by +0.2 in both the x and y directions.

# %%
# Initialise the tracks by creating an empty list and appending the priors generated. This needs to be done separately

# %%
# Reward function
# ---------------
# A reward function is used to quantify the benefit of sensors taking a particular action or set of actions.
# This can be crafted specifically for an example in order to achieve a particular objective. The function used in
# this example is quite generic but could be substituted for any callable function which returns a numeric
# value that the sensor manager can maximise.
# 
# The :class:`~.UncertaintyRewardFunction` calculates the uncertainty reduction by computing the difference between the
# covariance matrix norms of the prediction, and the posterior assuming a predicted measurement corresponding to that
# prediction.

from stonesoup.sensormanager.reward import UncertaintyRewardFunction

reward_function = UncertaintyRewardFunction(predictor=predictor, updater=updater)

# %%
# Reinforcement Learning
# ----------------------
# Reinforcement learning involves intelligent agents making decisions to maximise a cumulative reward. The agent
# must train in an environment in order to create a policy, which later determines the actions it will take. During
# training, the agent makes decisions and receives rewards, which it uses to optimise the policy.
# 
# .. figure:: ../_static/rl_training.png
#   :width: 800
#   :alt: Illustration of sequential actions and measurements
#
#   Illustration of an RL algorithm taking actions during training. The state and reward it receives are used to
#   determine the best actions.
# 
# Once training has completed, the policy can be exploited to gain rewards.
# 

# %%
# Design Environment
# ------------------
# An environment is needed for the RL agent to learn in. There are resources online for how to design these [#]_.
#
# In this example, the action space is equal to the number of targets in the simulation, so at each time step, the
# sensor can select one target to look at. For the environment, we make a copy of the sensor that we will pass to the
# sensor manager later on. This is so the agent can train in the environment without altering the sensor itself.
# The :class:`~.UncertaintyRewardFunction` is used to calculate the reward obtained for each step in the environment.
# The trace of the covariances for each object is used as the observation for the agent to learn from - it should learn
# to select targets with a larger covariance (higher uncertainty).

# RL Sensor Manager
# -----------------
# To be able to use the RL environment we have designed, we need to make a ReinforcementSensorManager class, which
# inherits from :class:`~.SensorManager`.
# 
# We introduce some additional methods that are used by tensorflow-agents: :func:`compute_avg_return`,
# :func:`dense_layer`, and :func:`train`.
# :func:`compute_avg_return` is used to find the average reward by using a given policy. This is used to evaluate the
# training.
# :func:`dense_layer` is used when generating the Q-Network, a neural network model that learns to predict Q-Values.
# :func:`train` is used to generate the policy by running a large number of episodes through the Q-Network to work out
# which actions are best. An episode in RL refers to a single run or instance of the learning process, where the agent
# interacts with the environment.
# 
# We also need to re-define the :func:`choose_actions` method from :class:`~.SensorManager` to be able to interface
# Stone Soup actions with tensorflow-agent actions.

# This metric shows that the uncertainty in the tracks generated by the :class:`~.ReinforcementSensorManager` is a
# little higher than for those generated by the :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager`. This is also reflected by the
# uncertainty ellipses in the initial plots of tracks and truths.
