        "## Introduction\nTracking cellular movement within biological imagery is a complex task. In\nthis demo we are using Stone Soup to track cells in confocal transmitted light\nimagery. Utilising tracking to be able to analyse single cell data over time\nfrom frame based population data increases the utility of the data set. It\nallows for the characteristics of individual cells to be monitored throughout\nthe time course, providing an additional dimension to the data set for\nanalyses. This demo shows how Stone Soup can be utilised for tracking of the\ncells. A number of packages in Python are available to generate morphological\nmetrics from the segmented datasets.\n\nIn this notebook we will load a csv file containing segmented cell data and metadata, to use as\ndetections in the Stone Soup tracker. We will build the tracker and use the Optuna framework to \noptimise the tracker over a number of parameters. We will display the track output in a video.\n\n"

        "## Software Dependencies\nA number of installations are required for this demonstration.\n\n### Cellpose\nCellpose is a deep learning-based algorithm for segmentation of cells and nuclei. There is also a\nhuman-in-the-loop option for training the model (v2.0). Cellpose is used to produce the csv of\nsegmented cell data used by the tracker. Installation instructions can be found\n[here](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose/blob/main/README.md/#Installation)_.\n\n### Optuna\nOptuna is a hyperparameter optimisation software. It can be used to explore the parameter space\nand find the optimal combination of parameters based on pre-defined metrics. Optuna is framework\nagnostic, so is easy to implement on any algorithm framework. Further details, including \ninstallation instructions, can be found\n[here](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)_.\n\n"

        "## Data\nIn this demo cell time lapse imagery was captured using confocal microscope time lapse imaging,\nusing a Zeiss LSM 710 microscope. This produced proprietary .czi files for analysis. A number of\nprocessing steps were performed before tracking algorithms were implemented. These steps are as\nfollows:\n\n1. Unpack the .czi file into individual frames and image channels (Brightfield and fluorescence) using the aicspylibczi library. \n2. Segment the images using Cellpose. To optimise this a range of different parameters were applied to a random set of the frames and these were visualised to select the best Cellpose parameters.\n3. Use best Cellpose parameters to segment all images within a time lapse experiment.\n4. From this the segmentations were used to derive population statistics using the sci-imaging library. \n5. The centroid_X and centroid_Y values of the bounding box for each cells were used in Stone Soup as the location of each individual cell.\n\nIt is important to note that the extraction of time lapse frames will differ depending on the\nconfocal imaging approach used. However, any microscope and segmentation approach could be\nutilised as long as within the end result you have the centroid_X and centroid_Y value to then\ninput into the Stone Soup tracking algorithms.  \n\n"

        "## Optimizer\nNext, we implement the Optuna optimizer on the Stone Soup algorithm. To do this, we first have to\ndefine an objective function. This is done through the following steps:\n\n1) Set the parameters to vary the values of. In this example all of the the parameters being changed are integers so the suggest_int function is used. The numbers passed in as arguments of the function are the minimum and maximum values that the parameter can take (inclusive).\n2) Run the algorithm. This is done as above, running through each frame to generate the tracks.\n3) Define metric(s) for optimisation. These are meant to be representative of the quality of the tracks, such that maximising or minimising these metrics will improve the tracking algorithm. The objective function returns the metric(s) defined for optimisation. In this case, these are the number of long tracks, defined as the number of tracks spanning at least 90% of the frames, and the total number of tracks. These are standardised to account for the difference in size of the two values, so that the multi-objective optimisation isn't weighted towards the metric that is the larger value (total number of tracks). Single-objective optimisation is also possible in Optuna, and indeed is the more widely used optimisation method. However, as there is no group truth for this problem, multi-objective optimisation was preferred in this case.\n\nWhile only integer values are changed in this demonstration, Optuna\ncan also be used to vary a range of other types of variables. See [here](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/optuna.trial.Trial.html)_\nfor more information.\n\nAlso, it is important to note that the default optimisation approach that Optuna uses is Bayesian\noptimisation, which works by randomly selecting the parameters for the first n trials (where n is\ntypically around 50) and then subsequently uses these values to determine which area of the\nparameter space is best to explore. In this demo, the number of trials is kept low (20) to reduce\nrun time, but for best results a higher number of trials should be used (e.g. >100).\n\n"

The\nimportance is given as a fraction of the change in the metric that the given hyperparameter is\nresponsible for (i.e., a hyperparameter importance of 1 indicates that any change to the metric\nis a result of changes to that hyperparameter only).\n\nThe hyperparameter importance plot for the long tracks metric indicates that the errors in the\nstate vector fields have the biggest impact on determining the number of long tracks produced by\nan algorithm, with the positional error being the most important. The hyperparameter importance\nplot for the total tracks metric shows that the minimum number of frames required for a track to\ninitiate has by far the biggest impact on the total number of tracks.\n\n"
