# One to One States Association Example
# ---------------------------------------
# The :class:`~.OneToOneAssociator` can be used for associating states with the right
# :attr:`~.OneToOneAssociator.measure`. Consider the scenario having two conflicting sources
# reporting the location of objects. An associator can be used to judge where multiple sensors are
# observing the same object. For simplicity a standard :class:`~.State` with no uncertainty
# information is used. This means the :class:`~.Euclidean` metric is appropriate to compare the
# states.


# %%
# Create States
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

# %%
# We have states from source A and source B marked as `states_from_a` and `states_from_b`
# respectively.

# %%
# **Summary**
#  * Five states from source A have been associated to five states from source B
#  * Three states aren’t associated to another state
#  * State a5 and b5 would be associated but the distance between them is above the threshold
#  * State b0 isn’t associated to a state due to there being better combinations of other states
