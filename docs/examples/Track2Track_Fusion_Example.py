Multi-Sensor Fusion: Covariance Intersection Using Tracks as Measurements
=========================================================================
"""


# %%
# Background
# ----------
# The Covariance Intersection Algorithm from Julier and Uhlmann [#]_ is a popular algorithm for
# track-to-track fusion in target tracking systems. This approach is highly appealing due to its
# robustness, simple structure, and applicability to any tracking system that uses Gaussians as the
# basis for tracking. Generalisations to non-Gaussian systems have been proposed based on the
# exponential mixture density structure of the algorithm. The approach is based on a simple rule
# called the Chernoff Fusion Rule. However, due to the non-Bayesian formulation of the rule, it
# cannot be integrated straightforwardly into multi-target tracking algorithms which are based on
# Bayesian formulations.
#
# A new Bayesian formulation for covariance intersection was recently proposed which allows for the
# integration of the approach into multi-target tracking algorithms. [#]_ The new formulation
# recasts the fusion rule as a Bayesian update rule that calculates a normalisation constant which
# enables integration into different multi-target tracking algorithms.
#
# In this example we demonstrate the approach with different multi-target trackers in a
# multi-platform scenario where the sensors output estimated target tracks instead of raw
# measurements. In real life situations, such sensors make multi-target tracking more accessible to
# new researchers because the researchers don't have to know about or implement target filtering
# and/or tracking algorithms on their own. However, when there are multiple sensors measuring the
# same target space and they all produce estimated tracks, as demonstrated in this example, it is
# not immediately clear how to combine this information into a single set of tracks. This is where
# covariance intersection comes in.
#
# The concept of covariance intersection relies on the aforementioned Chernoff fusion rule [#]_ :
#
# .. math::
#           p_{\omega}(x_{k}) = \frac{p_{1}(x_{k})^{\omega}p_{2}(x_{k})^{1-\omega}}{\int p_{1}(x)^{\omega}p_{2}(x)^{1-\omega}dx}
#
#
# In situations where :math:`p_1(x)` and :math:`p_2(x)` are multivariate Gaussian distributions,
# this formula is equal to the Covariance Intersection Algorithm from Julier and Uhlmann. In the
# Covariance Intersection Algorithm, the weighting parameter, :math:`\omega \in [0, 1]` is chosen
# using an optimization algorithm. In this example, we have set it to :math:`0.5` for simplicity.
#
# We also introduce the following identity. Given two Gaussians, :math:`N(x ; a, A)` and
# :math:`N(x ; b, B)` with the same dimension, we have:
#
# .. math::
#           \left({\frac{\mathcal{N}(x ; a, A)}{\mathcal{N}(x ; a, A)}}\right)^\omega \mathcal{N}(x ; b,  B) \propto \mathcal{N}(a ; b,  V) \mathcal{N}(x ; d,  D)
#
#
# where
#
# .. math::
#           D &= \left(\omega A^{-1}+(1-\omega) B^{-1}\right)^{-1} \\
#           d &= D\left(\omega A^{-1} {a}+(1-\omega ) B^{-1} {b}\right) \\
#           V &= A/(1-\omega )+ B/\omega
#
#
# This example considers the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) algorithm
# as the tracker for the track-to-track fusion. The following table shows the formulas used in the
# regular GM-PHD, and the GM-PHD covariance intersector algorithm.

#
#
# The specifics for implementing the Covariance Intersection Algorithm in several popular
# multi-target tracking algorithms was expanded upon recently by Clark et al [#]_. The work
# includes a discussion of Stone Soup and and is used as the basis for this example.


# %%
# The rest of this example will continue as follows:
#   * Create a simulator for the ground truth
#   * Create 2 radar simulators, one on the ground and one that is airborne
#   * Make a JPDA tracker for the first radar, and a Gaussian mixture linear complexity with
#     cumulants (GM-LCC) tracker for the second. These will mimic the situation where the radar
#     sensors outputs tracks instead of raw measurements.
#   * Create a GM-PHD tracker that will perform measurement fusion, using all measurements from
#     both radars. This is created to compare with the covariance intersection method.
#   * Create a GM-PHD tracker that will perform track fusion via covariance intersection using
#     the :class:`ChernoffUpdater` class.
#   * Create a metric manager to generate metrics for each of the four trackers
#   * Set up the detection feeders. Each tracker will receive measurements using a custom
#     :class:`DummyDetector` class. The track fusion tracker will also use the
#     :class:`Tracks2GaussianDetectionFeeder` class.
#   * Run the simulation
#   * Plot the resulting tracks and the metrics over time

# (hopefully) have ignored some of the clutter, we can use a smaller intensity than in the previous
# trackers. The `omega` parameter is also adjustable. We will set it to 0.5 for now.

# The remaining tracker parameters have been kept the same as the measurement fusion tracker except

# 9: Plot the Results
# --------------------
# Next, we will plot all of the resulting tracks and measurements. This will be done in two plots.
# The first plot will show all of the data, and the second plot will show a closer view of one
# resultant track.
#
# These plots are done in 2D to make them more readable. We invite the reader to explore the plot
# interactively using the following line in an active Jupyter session.
