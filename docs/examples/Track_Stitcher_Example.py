Track Stitching Example
=========================================================================
"""
# %%
# Introduction
# ------------
# Track Stitching considers a set of broken fragments of track (which we call tracklets), and aims
# to identify which fragments should be stitched (joined) together to form one track. This is done
# by considering the state of a tracked object and predicting its state at a future (or past) time.
# This example generates a set of `tracklets`, before applying track stitching. The figure below
# visualizes the aim of track stitching: taking a set of tracklets (left, black) and producing a set
# of tracks (right, blue/red).

# %%
# Track Stitching Method
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Consider the following scenario: We have a bunch of sections of track that are all disconnected
# from each other. We aim to stitch the track sections together into full tracks. We can use the
# known states of tracklets at known times to predict where the tracked object would be at a
# different time. We can use this information to associate tracklets with each other. Methods of
# associating tracklets are explained below.
#
# Predicting forward
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# For a given track section, we consider the state at the end-point of the track, say state
# :math:`x` at the time that the observation was made, call this time :math:`k`. We use the state of
# the object to predict the state at time :math:`k + \delta k`. If the state at the start point of
# another track section falls within an acceptable range of this prediction, we may associate the
# tracks and stitch them together. This method is used in the function `forward_predict`.
#
# Predicting backward
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Similarly to predicting forward, we can consider the state at the start point of a track section,
# call this time :math:`k`, and predict what the state would have been at time :math:`k - \delta k`.
# We can then associate and stitch tracks together as before. This method is used in the function
# `backward_predict`.
#
# Using both predictions
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# We can use both methods at the same time to calculate the probability that two track sections are
# part of the same track. The track stitcher in this example uses the `KalmanPredictor` to make
# predictions about which tracklets should be stitched into the same track.

# Scenario Generation
# -------------------
# Set Variables for Scenario Generation
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# The code below contains parameters used to generate input truth paths.
#
# The `number_of_targets` is the total number of truth paths generated in the initial simulation.
#
# The starting location of each truth path is defined in the region (-`range_value`, `range_value`)
# in all dimensions.
#
# Each truth object is split into a number of segments chosen randomly from the range
# (1, `max_segments`).
#
# You can define the minimum and maximum length that segments can be, by setting
# `min_segment_length` and `max_segment_length`, respectively.
#
# Similarly, the length of disjoint sections can be bounded by `min_disjoint_length` and
# `max_disjoint_length`.
#
# The start time of each truth path is bounded between :math:`t` = 0 and :math:`t` =
# `max_track_start`.
#
# The simulation will run for any number of spacial dimensions, given by `n_spacial_dimensions`.
#
# Finally, the transition model can be set by setting `TM` to either "CV" or "KTR" as indicated in
# the comments in the code below.

# no 'truth' data is used in track stitching - in this tutorial it is only used for generating
# tracklets and for evaluation of track stitching results.

# Track Stitcher Class

# using fowards and backwards stitching, predictions from both methods are merged together.
# They calculate which pairs of tracks could possibly be stitched together. The function `stitch`
# uses `forward_predict` and `backward_predict` to pair and 'stitch' track sections together.

from stonesoup.stitcher import TrackStitcher

# %%
# Applying the Track Stitcher
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Now that we have a set of tracklets, we can apply the Track Stitching method to stitch tracklets
# together into tracks. The code in the following cell applies this process using the class
# `TrackStitcher` and plots the stitched tracks.
# `TrackStitcher` has a property search_window that enables you to reduce compute time by filtering
# out track segments that are not within a determined time window. When forward stitching, the
# associator will consider any track that has a start point that falls within the time window
# :math:`(t, t + search_window)`. When backward stitching, the associator will consider tracks that
# have an endpoint within the time window :math:`(t - search_window, t)`.

# Applying Metrics

# SIAP Metrics
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^
# The following cell calculates and records a range of SIAP (Single Integrated Air Picture) metrics
# to assess the accuracy of the stitcher. The value of math:`association_threshold` should be
# adjusted to represent the acceptable distance for association for the scenario that is being
# considered. For example, associating with a threshold of 50 metres may be acceptable if tracking a
# large ship, but not so useful for tracking biological cell movement.
#
# SIAP Ambiguity: Important as a value not equal to 1 suggests that the stitcher is not stitching
# whole tracks together, or stitching multiple tracks into one.
#
# SIAP Completeness: Not a valuable metric for track stitching evaluation as we are only tracking
# fractions of the true objects - metric value is scaled by the ratio of truthlets to
# disjoint sections.
#
# SIAP Rate of Track Number Change: Important metric for assessing track stitching. Any value above
# zero is showing that tracklets are being incorrectly stitched to tracklets from different truth
# paths.
