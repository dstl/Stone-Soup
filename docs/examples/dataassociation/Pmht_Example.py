Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracker
======================================

# %%
# The Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracker (PMHT) is an advanced tracking algorithm designed to
# handle multiple hypotheses in a tracking scenario. Originally introduced by Streit and
# Luginbuhl [#]_, [#]_ and [#]_, the PMHT is particularly useful when dealing with complex
# scenarios.
# Such scenarios include the presence of multiple potential targets and uncertainties in
# measurements.
#
# In PMHT, the objective is to track multiple targets evolving independently over time.
# Each target's movement is modelled probabilistically, typically using a Markov transition model.
# In each time step, received measurements can correspond to either one of the target models or
# clutter. Clutter refers to measurements that do not correspond to any actual target.
#
# One of the key challenges in multi-target tracking is data association, i.e., correctly
# associating measurements with their respective targets. PMHT addresses this by considering
# multiple hypotheses for  data association.
# This enables different associations between measurements and targets.
#
# Let the motion of target :math:`m` from time step :math:`t-1` to :math:`t` be given by
# the following Markov transition model:
#
# .. math::
#           p(x^m_t | x^m_{t-1}) = \phi^m_t(x^m_t | x^m_{t-1})
#
# Let :math:`k^t_r` be the target which generates measurement :math:`r` at time step :math:`t`.
# Then the measurement :math:`z^t_r` conditional on the assignment is assumed to be given by
# the following measurement model:
#
# .. math::
#          p(z^t_r | x^{m}_t, k^t_r = m) = \begin{cases} 1/V & \text{if }
#          k^t_r = 0 \\ \zeta(z^t_r | x_m) & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}
#
# We denote by :math:`X` the joint states of all targets over time steps 1 to :math:`T`, and
# similarly let :math:`Z` and :math:`K` denote the joint measurement and association variables.
# Unlike data association algorithms, such as the JPDA Filter, the PMHT ignores the constraint
# that each target can generate at most one detection.
# This simplification allows us to write down the joint probability as:
#
# .. math::
#          p(Z, X, K | \Pi) = \left(\prod_{m=1}^M \phi^m_0(x^m_0)\right)\prod_{t=1}^T\left\{
#          \left(\prod_{m=1}^M \phi^m_t(x^m_t | x^m_{t-1}) \right)
#          \left(\prod_{r=1}^{n_t}\pi_t^{k^t_r}
#          \zeta\left(z^t_r | x^{k^t_r}_t\right) \right) \right\}
#
# where :math:`\pi^m_t` is the prior probability of a measurement at time step :math:`t` being
# assigned to target :math:`m` (or clutter if :math:`m=0`), and :math:`\Pi` is the joint variable
# over all target hypotheses and time steps.
# From this, the algorithm proceeds in a manner similar to the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm.
# Given an initial estimate :math:`X` of the target states and :math:`\Pi` of the association
# probabilities, we choose new values :math:`X` and :math:`\Pi` which maximise
#
# .. math::
#         Q(\Pi, X | \Pi^\prime, X^\prime) = \sum_K \left\{\log p(Z, X, K | \Pi)p(K | Z, X^\prime,
#         \Pi^\prime)\right\}
#
# This is repeated over a number of iterations. In this implementation, the prior means are used
# for the initial estimates of the target states for the first batch of measurements.
# For subsequent batches, we keep an overlap of a configurable number of time steps and predict
# forward using the prior means.

# maximum iteration limit.
# Though a convergence test might stop iterations early, the current setup runs all iterations.
# The algorithm can maintain and update prior probabilities of data association, affecting
# performance based on the application.

# Key points
# ----------
# 1. PMHT uses a probabilistic framework and Bayesian recursion to update beliefs about target
#    states.
#    It accounts for uncertainties in target motion and measurement noise.
# 2. An essential aspect of PMHT is the association of predicted target states with measurements.
#    This association step, called data association, involves matching measurements to targets.
#    PMHT uses algorithms or methods for hypothesis generation and evaluation.
#    This helps in effectively associating measurements with predicted target states.
