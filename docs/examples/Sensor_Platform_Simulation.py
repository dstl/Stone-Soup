Sensor Platform Simulation Example
==================================
This example looks at how platforms and sensors can be used within the Stone Soup simulation capability.
"""

# %%
# Building a Simulated Sensor Platform
# ------------------------------------
# The focus of this example is to show how to setup and configure simulations, as such the application of a tracker
# will not be covered in detail. For more information about trackers and how to configure them review of the
# tutorials and demonstrations is recommended.
#
# This example makes use of Stone Soup :class:`~.FixedPlatform` and :class:`~.Sensor` objects.
#
# In order to configure platforms, sensors and the simulation we will need to import some specific Stone Soup objects.
# As these have been introduced in previous tutorials they are imported upfront. New functionality within this example
# will be imported at the relevant point in order to draw attention to the new features.

# Some general imports and set up
from datetime import datetime
from datetime import timedelta

import numpy as np

# Stone Soup imports:
from stonesoup.types.state import State, GaussianState
from stonesoup.types.array import StateVector, CovarianceMatrix
from stonesoup.models.transition.linear import (
    CombinedLinearGaussianTransitionModel, ConstantVelocity)
from stonesoup.models.measurement.nonlinear import CartesianToElevationBearingRange
from stonesoup.updater.kalman import UnscentedKalmanUpdater
from stonesoup.predictor.kalman import UnscentedKalmanPredictor
from stonesoup.deleter.time import UpdateTimeStepsDeleter
from stonesoup.tracker.simple import MultiTargetTracker
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Define the simulation start time
start_time = datetime.now()

# %%
# Create a Platform
# -----------------
# The first element we need to create is a platform. For this first example we will build a static (or *fixed*) platform
# which is located at the origin. For this example we are going to work in a 6-dimensional state space our platform will
# have the following :math:`\mathbf{x}`.
#
# .. math::
#           \begin{align}\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
#                                       x\\ \dot{x}\\ y\\ \dot{y}\\ z\\ \dot{z} \end{bmatrix}
#                                   = \begin{bmatrix}
#                                       0\\ 0\\ 0\\ 0\\ 0\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\end{align}
#
# Because the platform is static we only need to define :math:`(x, y, z)`, any internal interaction with the platform
# which requires knowledge of platform velocity :math:`(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z})` will be returned :math:`(0, 0, 0)`.

# First import the fixed platform
from stonesoup.platform.base import FixedPlatform

# Define the initial platform position, in this case the origin
platform_state_vector = StateVector([[0], [0], [0]])
position_mapping = (0, 1, 2)

# Create the initial state (position, time), notice it is set to the simulation start time defined earlier
platform_state = State(platform_state_vector, start_time)

# create our fixed platform
platform = FixedPlatform(states=platform_state,
                         position_mapping=position_mapping)

# %%
# We have now created a platform within Stone Soup and located it at the origin of our state space. As previously stated
# the platform will have a velocity :math:`(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z})` of :math:`(0, 0, 0)` which we can check:
platform.velocity

# %%
# We can also query the platform orientation:
platform.orientation

# %%
# Create a Sensor
# ---------------
# Now that we have a platform the next step is to create a sensor which can be added to the platform. In this example a
# Radar will be created which is capable of measuring the range, bearing and elevation of the target relative to the
# sensor.
#
# The :class:`~.RadarRangeBearingElevation`  provides a sensor wrapper around the
# :class:`~.CartesianToElevationBearingRange` measurement model. The measurement model provides a time-invariant
# measurement model, where measurements are assumed to be received in the form of elevation (:math:`\theta`),
# bearing (:math:`\phi`) and range (:math:`r`) with Gaussian noise in each dimension.
#
# The model is described by the following equations:
#
# .. math::
#           \begin{align} \mathbf{z}_k = h(\mathbf{x}_k, \dot{\mathbf{x}}_k) \end{align}
#
# where :math:`\mathbf{z}_k` is a measurement vector of the form:
#
# .. math::
#           \begin{align} \mathbf{z}_k = \begin{bmatrix} \theta \\ \phi \\ r \end{bmatrix} \end{align}
#
# and :math:`h` is a non-linear model function of the form:
#
# .. math::
#           \begin{align} h(\mathbf{x}_k,\dot{\mathbf{x}}_k) = \begin{bmatrix}
#                                        \arcsin{(\mathcal{z}/\sqrt{\mathcal{x}^2 + \mathcal{y}^2 +\mathcal{z}^2})} \\
#                                        \arctan{(\mathcal{y},\mathcal{x})} \\
#                                        \sqrt{\mathcal{x}^2 + \mathcal{y}^2 + \mathcal{z}^2}
#                                        \end{bmatrix} + \dot{\mathbf{x}}_k \end{align}
#
# and finally :math:`\mathbf{z}_k` is Gaussian distributed with covariance :math:`R`, i.e.:
#
# .. math::
#           \begin{align} \mathbf{z}_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0,R) \end{align}
#
# .. math::
#           \begin{align} R = \begin{bmatrix}
#                           \sigma_{\theta}^2 & 0 & 0 \\
#                           0 & \sigma_{\phi}^2 & 0 \\
#                           0 & 0 & \sigma_{r}^2
#                           \end{bmatrix} \end{align}
#
# We now create our radar.

# Import a radar sensor model
from stonesoup.sensor.radar.radar import RadarRangeBearingElevation

# First we need to configure a radar

# Generate a radar sensor with a suitable measurement accuracy
noise_covar = CovarianceMatrix(np.array(np.diag([np.deg2rad(3)**2,
                                                 np.deg2rad(0.15)**2,
                                                 25**2])))
# this radar measures range with an accuracy of +/- 25m, and elevation accuracy +/- 3
# degrees and bearing accuracy of +/- 0.15 degrees

# The radar needs to be informed of where x, y, and z are in the target state space
radar_mapping = (0, 2, 4)

# Instantiate the radar
radar = RadarRangeBearingElevation(ndim_state=6,
                                   position_mapping=radar_mapping,
                                   noise_covar=noise_covar)
# %%
# Attach the sensor to the platform
# ---------------------------------
# Now that we have created our radar sensor we need to mount the sensor onto the platform we have previously created.
#
# Sensors can be mounted with two additional parameters; the mounting offset and rotation offset.
#
# The mounting offset:
#     * defines how the sensors position is offset from the platform,
#     * defaults to a position offset of zero.
# The rotation_offset:
#     * defines the sensors orientation relative to that of the platform,
#     * defaults to a zero orientation offset.
#
# The default assumption is that the sensor is located at the center point of the platform and orientated to align with
# the platform body. In this example we are happy to use the default assumptions and therefore the sensor can be added.
platform.add_sensor(radar)

# %%
# As before we can query the platform to demonstrate that it has a sensor mounted:
platform.sensors

# %%
# You will notice that platform.sensors returns a list which contains our single sensor. This hints at the multi-sensor
# platform functionality which is shown in a subsequent example.
#
# We can also check to ensure that the default mounting_offsets have been applied:
platform.mounting_offsets

# %%
# And that the rotation_offsets have been applied:
platform.rotation_offsets

# %%
# Building a simulation
# ---------------------
# Now that we have created a sensor platform we need to build a simulation which generates targets for the sensor to
# detect and track. For this example we are going to use a :class:`~.MultiTargetGroundTruthSimulator`. this simulator
# enables multiple ground truth targets to be created based on a number of user defined parameters.
#
# In this example targets are initiated with values based upon a mean state and a covariance, using a Gaussian
# assumption. This is done by creating a :class:`~.GaussianState` object which describes the distribution from which we
# want our targets to be drawn from. For this example targets will be generated using the following parameters:
#   * :math:`x` is Gaussian distributed around the platform location with variance of :math:`\mathrm{2}km`
#   * :math:`y` is Gaussian distributed around the platform location with variance of :math:`\mathrm{2}km`
#   * :math:`z` is Gaussian distributed around an altitude of :math:`\mathrm{9}km` with variance of :math:`\mathrm{0.1}km`
#   * :math:`\dot{x}` is Gaussian distributed around :math:`\mathrm{100}ms^{-1}` with variance of :math:`\mathrm{50}ms^{-1}`
#   * :math:`\dot{y}` is Gaussian distributed around :math:`\mathrm{100}ms^{-1}` with variance of :math:`\mathrm{50}ms^{-1}`
#   * :math:`\dot{z}` is Gaussian distributed around :math:`\mathrm{0}ms^{-1}` with variance of :math:`\mathrm{1}ms^{-1}`
#
# We will also configure our simulator to randomly create and delete targets, based on a birth rate and death rate we
# specify. In this example we set the birth rate to be 0.10, i.e. on any given time step there is a 10% chance of a new
# target being initiated. We have set the death rate to 0.01, i.e. on any given time step there is a 1% chance that a
# target will be removed from the simulation.
#
# The above setup will provide a case which loosely approximates an air surveillance radar at an airport.
from stonesoup.simulator.simple import MultiTargetGroundTruthSimulator

# Set a constant velocity transition model for the targets
transition_model = CombinedLinearGaussianTransitionModel(
    [ConstantVelocity(0.5), ConstantVelocity(0.5), ConstantVelocity(0.1)])

# Define the Gaussian State from which new targets are sampled on initialisation
initial_target_state = GaussianState(StateVector([[0], [0], [0], [0], [9000], [0]]),
                                     CovarianceMatrix(np.diag([2000, 50, 2000, 50, 100, 1])))

groundtruth_sim = MultiTargetGroundTruthSimulator(
    transition_model=transition_model,  # target transition model
    initial_state=initial_target_state,  # add our initial state for targets
    timestep=timedelta(seconds=1),  # time between measurements
    number_steps=120,  # 2 minute
    birth_rate=0.10,  # 10% chance of a new target being born
    death_probability=0.01  # 1% chance of a target being killed
)

# %%
# Now that we have set up our ground truth simulation we need to add our platform into the simulation capability. This
# is done using the :class:`~.PlatformDetectionSimulator`. This simulator allows a *list* of platforms to be added into
# the simulation, when the simulation is processed the platforms are able to make detections of both the ground truth
# targets and other platforms.
#
# In this case we have a single platform, therefore the radar sensor on this platform will only be able to make
# measurements of the ground truth objects generated by the simulator.

# Import the PlatformDetectionSimulator
from stonesoup.simulator.platform import PlatformDetectionSimulator

sim = PlatformDetectionSimulator(groundtruth=groundtruth_sim, platforms=[platform])

# %%
# Creating the Tracker Components
# -------------------------------
# As stated above the aim of this example is to show how :class:`~.Platform`, :class:`~.Sensor` and
# :class:`~.Simulator` work within Stone Soup. We will therefore quickly build an Unscented Kalman Filter which
# initiates measurements using a simple heuristic initiation and deletes any track where no detection is associated for
# 2 consecutive time steps. There are a number of tutorials for how to build the tracking components provided in the
# :ref:`auto_tutorials`.

# Create an Unscented Kalman Predictor
predictor = UnscentedKalmanPredictor(transition_model)

# Create an Unscented Kalman Updater, note our sensor adds a measurement model to detections
updater = UnscentedKalmanUpdater(measurement_model=None)

# %%
# When we build our updater you will notice that we do not provide a measurement model. This is because we
# have defined a measurement model which is attached to our radar sensor, each detection made by this sensor
# will have our radar measurement model associated with it. In Stone Soup the :class:`~.Updater` checks the
# detections provided and will use any measurement model attached to the detection.


# %%
# Setup Initiator class for the Tracker
# -------------------------------------
# We will now build a simple heuristic initiator.
# This assumes most of the deviation is caused by the bearing measurement error. It converts the bearing error error
# into :math:`x, y` components using the target bearing. For z, we simply use :math:`r*\sigma_{\theta}^2` (this ignores
# any bearing or range related components). Velocity covariances are just based on expected velocity range of targets.

# %%
# To familiarise yourself with sensors it is recommended that you investigate changing the parameters within the sensor
# Measurement Model in order to see the impact on detections and ultimately tracker performance. For this example we
# used a *hard* association logic coupled with a relatively noisy sensor. A suggested further exercise is to modify this
# example to use a *soft* association step such as Probabilistic Data Association (:class:`~.PDA`) or
# Joint Probabilistic Data Association (:class:`~.JPDA`).

# %%
# Key points
# ----------
# 1. Sensor platforms, which combine :class:`~.Sensor` and :class:`~.Platform` can be created in Stone Soup and used
#    as part of a tracking simulation.
# 2. When using a :class:`~.Sensor` to generate detections there is no need to provide an :class:`~.Updater` with a
#    :class:`~.MeasurementModel` as each detection is attributed with the relevant sensors measurement model.
# 3. Sensors will generate detections of all platforms within the simulation, not just ground truth objects.
