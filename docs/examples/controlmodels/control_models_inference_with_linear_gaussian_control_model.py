"""
Control Models: Inference with Linear Gaussian Control Model
============================================================
"""

# %% [markdown]
# This example demonstrates the use of a simple control model which can be used to improve
# inference when the control input of the target system is known. This allows manoeuvres
# to be accounted for without relying on high process noise to enable deviations from the
# motion model. This does however rely on **a**) knowing the underlying control model of
# the system, **b**) knowing the inputs that the system is making and when it is making
# them. This limits the application of this technique, usually, to scenarios where the
# tracker and target both belong to the same owner.
#
# The example will proceed as follows:
#   1. Import some required modules
#   2. Define a simple linear control model and its class
#   3. Generate ground truth target trajectory
#   4. Generate measurements
#   5. Define and run baseline Kalman filter
#   6. Define and run Kalman filter with control
#   7. Compare performance

# %%
# Standard external module imports and Environment Setup
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# First some packages used throughout the example are imported and random numbers are
# seeded and fixed for repeatability.

# General imports
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Start simulation time
start_time = datetime.now()
# Use a non-unit time increment (and vary it) to check the various matrices are
# calculated correctly
time_interval = timedelta(seconds=0.5)

# Seed random number generation for repeatability
np.random.seed(1991)

# %%
# Define Control Model
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Control models invoke a second term in the state-space motion model representation.
# Omitting any noise terms, the motion model is now given by
#
# .. math::
#     \mathbf{x}_{k} = F_{k}\mathbf{x}_{k-1} + B_{k}\mathbf{u}_k
#
# where :math:`B_{k}` is the control matrix and :math:`\mathbf{u}_{k}` is the control input both
# at time :math:`k`. It is clear that the first term above is applying the standard transition
# according to the current state and transition matrix while the second term is
# manipulating this according to an applied action. This could be an acceleration for
# example, which gets mapped and applied to the state vector through :math:`B_k`.
#
# In this example, we define a linear constant acceleration control model which applies
# an acceleration input across the interval between :math:`k-1` and :math:`k`. The state vector
# will include position and velocity. Therefore, by the equations of motion, this
# makes the control matrix
#
# .. math::
#     B_k = \left[\begin{array}{c}
#         \frac{\Delta t^2}{2} \\
#         \Delta t
#     \end{array}\right]
#
# for each dimension. This can be concatenated over multiple dimensions, in a similar
# way to the transition matrix, as
#
# .. math::
#     B_k^D = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
#         B_k^1 & \cdots & \mathbf{0} \\
#         \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
#         \mathbf{0} & \cdots & B_k^D
#     \end{array}\right]
#
# for :math:`D` dimensions.

# %%
# Defining the Control Model Class
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# To define the control model class, we will create a variant of :class:`~.LinearControlModel` and
#  ovewrite the :attr:`~.LinearControlModel.matrix` attribute according to the above expression.

# %%
# Generate Ground Truth
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Now that the control model is defined, it can be used to create the ground truth
# for the target. There are two main differences compared to generating ground truth
# without a control model. The first is deciding on the control input which is required; it
# should be stored for use later in the filtering process. The second is having to apply
# the transition model function and the control model function when progressing states.
#
# In this example, the target will undergo two manoeuvres. The first starts at 40 seconds,
# lasts 50 seconds and will be a turn to the right; the second manoeuvre 
# at 120 seconds, again lasting 50 seconds, will be a turn to the left. Nominally, the
# target will traverse according to nearly constant velocity when not manoeuvering.
#
# First we define the models and populate the required parameters.
